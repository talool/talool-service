# Because there are no cascade deletes on deal offers or merchants currently (and there is good reason to not have these),
# the below queries show what needs to happen in order to delete a deal_offer

###################################################

delete from deal_tag where deal_id in (select deal_id from deal,deal_offer where deal_offer.title='PaybackBook #1' and deal_offer.deal_offer_id=deal.deal_offer_id);

delete from deal_acquire where deal_id in (select deal_id from deal,deal_offer where deal_offer.title='PaybackBook #1' and deal_offer.deal_offer_id=deal.deal_offer_id );

delete from deal where deal_offer_id in (select deal_offer_id from deal_offer where title='PaybackBook #1');

delete from deal_offer where title='PaybackBook #1';

#### Example on how to remove a merchant (do these in order) 

delete from merchant_location where merchant_id in ( select merchant_id from merchant where merchant_name like 'Merch%');

delete from merchant_media where merchant_id in ( select merchant_id from merchant where merchant_name like 'Merch%');

delete from merchant_account where merchant_id in ( select merchant_id from merchant where merchant_name like 'Merch%');

delete from merchant_tag where merchant_id in ( select merchant_id from merchant where merchant_name like 'Merch%');

delete from merchant where merchant_name like 'Merch%';
